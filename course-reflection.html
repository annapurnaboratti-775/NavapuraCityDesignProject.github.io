  Section 2 – Course Reflections
</h1>

<p class="subtitle">
  A deeper and more personal reflection on how the concepts from the Design and Analysis of 
  Algorithms course reshaped my understanding of problem solving, system design, and real-world application.

    <div class="card-header">
      <h2>1. Problems in Nature: Iteration, Recursion & Backtracking</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">🌿</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Observing nature made algorithms feel alive and intuitive. Waves crashing repeatedly represented 
        <strong>iteration</strong>, tree branch splits reflected <strong>recursion</strong>, and ants exploring, 
        failing, and retrying mirrored <strong>backtracking</strong>. Algorithms began to feel like patterns 
        hidden in the real world, not just abstract code.

      <h2>2. Space & Time Efficiency – Why They Matter</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">⏳</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Efficiency is not just a technical term anymore — it’s a mindset.  
        Understanding time and space complexity taught me that good solutions are not only correct, 
        but also scalable. At city-scale systems, inefficient solutions are simply not usable.
      </p>

    <div class="card-header">
      <h2>3. Design Principles I Take Forward</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">🧩</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Concepts like decomposition, modularity, and abstraction changed my thinking.  
        Breaking complex problems into simpler parts made everything manageable — not just code, 
        but real-world systems and my own workflow.
      </p>
    </div>

  <!-- Reflection 4 -->
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-header">
      <h2>4. How Trees Optimise Data</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">🌲</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Trees taught me how structure influences performance. BSTs speed up search, AVL trees keep 
        balance, heaps prioritise tasks, and tries make string operations efficient. In our project, 
        trees helped organise complex data clearly and quickly.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Why Segment Trees / Fenwick Trees?</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">📊</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Faced with frequent updates and range queries, basic techniques were too slow.  
        Segment Trees and Fenwick Trees made these operations fast and reliable, revealing 
        how advanced data structures power real-time analytics.
      </p>

  <!-- Reflection 6 -->

    <div class="card-header">
      <h2>6. Trees vs Graphs – A Shift in Perspective</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">🗺️</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Trees organise data — but graphs model the world. Viewing city elements as nodes and edges 
        made graph algorithms like BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra feel like tools for real exploration and routing.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Reflection 7 -->

    <div class="card-header">
      <h2>7. Sorting & Searching – Real-World Importance</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">🔍</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Sorting and searching are everywhere: ranking emergencies, locating resources, filtering data.  
        These “basic” algorithms are the silent engines driving efficiency beneath the surface.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Graph Algorithms – Why They Matter</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">🔗</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Graph algorithms became the backbone of our city logic.  
        Minimum spanning trees help optimise infrastructure, Dijkstra guides routing,  
        BFS supports evacuation planning — the abstract became practical.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Algorithm Design Insights</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">🧠</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Each strategy offered a mindset: brute force for completeness, greedy for fast decisions, 
        divide-and-conquer for clarity, backtracking for exploration, and dynamic programming for efficiency.  
        Algorithm design became a philosophy, not just a tool.

      <h2>10. How This Project Changed Me</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">💡</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        This project made algorithms meaningful.  
        A shortest path became a life-saving route; a graph became a resilient city blueprint.  
        I now see code as empathy with logic — a way to solve problems that truly matter.
