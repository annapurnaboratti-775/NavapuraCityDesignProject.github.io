      <h2>1. Most Impactful Concept Learned</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">📘</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      The most impactful concept for me was understanding how <strong>time and space complexity</strong>
      influence real-world performance. Before this course, I only focused on writing code that works.
      Now I understand <em>why efficiency</em> matters more in real applications.
      Choosing the right data structure can turn a slow solution into a lightning-fast one.

      <h2>2. How My Perspective on Algorithms Evolved</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">💡</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      At first, algorithms felt like complicated procedures to memorize. But as we progressed,
      I realized they are actually <strong>structured ways of thinking</strong>.
      They help break big problems into clear logical steps.  
      This mindset changed how I now approach and solve every technical problem.

      <h2>3. Challenges Faced During the Project</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">⚙️</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      The biggest challenge was selecting the <strong>right algorithm</strong> for each subsystem
      of our Smart Emergency Response System. We constantly compared BFS, Dijkstra, Segment Trees,
      and hashing to justify every choice.  
      This forced me not just to use algorithms, but to understand their purpose and efficiency deeply.

    <div class="card-header">
      <h2>4. How the Team Project Strengthened My Learning</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">🤝</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Working in a team gave me a deeper understanding of algorithmic problem-solving.
      Everyone contributed different insights, and discussing them made concepts clearer.
      We evaluated trade-offs, feasibility, and efficiency — just like real engineering teams do.

      <h2>5. A Concept I Initially Struggled With</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">📉</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      I initially struggled with <strong>Segment Trees</strong> — especially understanding how queries
      and updates work in logarithmic time.  
      But once I implemented them and connected the idea to real-world uses (like crime-frequency queries),
      it became one of my favorite topics.

    <div class="card-header">
      <h2>6. Skills I Gained From This Course</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">🚀</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      The most valuable skill I gained is the ability to <strong>justify algorithmic choices</strong>.
      I can now analyze time complexity, understand trade-offs, and design solutions that scale.
      This analytical mindset will help me in interviews, competitive programming,
      projects, and real-world software engineering.
