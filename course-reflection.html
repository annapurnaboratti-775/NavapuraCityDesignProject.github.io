    <p style="color:#d1d5db; line-height:1.7;">
      The most impactful concept for me was understanding how the choice of data structure directly affects 
      the efficiency of an algorithm. Earlier, I only focused on writing code that “works,” but this course 
      helped me see the importance of writing code that works <strong>efficiently</strong>.  
      Learning how graphs, priority queues, and hashing influence real-world systems completely changed the 
      way I approach problem-solving.

    <h2 style="color:#a5b4fc; font-size:1.4rem; margin-bottom:10px;">2. How did your perspective on algorithms evolve during the course?</h2>
    <p style="color:#d1d5db; line-height:1.7;">
      Initially, I saw algorithms as lengthy code templates to memorize. But through assignments, project work, 
      and class discussions, I realized algorithms are actually <strong>strategies for thinking</strong>.  
      Every algorithm starts with a question—“What is the most optimal way to do this?”  
      This mindset shift helped me appreciate why the same problem can be solved in multiple ways but only 
      one approach is truly efficient.

    <h2 style="color:#a5b4fc; font-size:1.4rem; margin-bottom:10px;">3. What challenges did you face while applying algorithms in your project?</h2>
    <p style="color:#d1d5db; line-height:1.7;">
      One of the main challenges was selecting the <strong>appropriate algorithm</strong> for each real-world scenario 
      in our Smart Emergency Response System.  
      We had to justify why Dijkstra was better than BFS for routing, or why segment trees made more sense for 
      time-based queries. This made me think deeper and understand the “why” behind each choice, not just the “how.”

    <h2 style="color:#a5b4fc; font-size:1.4rem; margin-bottom:10px;">4. How did the team project help reinforce your learning?</h2>
    <p style="color:#d1d5db; line-height:1.7;">
      Working as a team helped me understand how different people interpret the same problem differently.  
      When discussing algorithms like BFS, hashing, or priority queues, we often debated which method gives the 
      best efficiency.  
      This collaboration made the learning environment more realistic—similar to how real software engineering 
      teams make decisions.

    <h2 style="color:#a5b4fc; font-size:1.4rem; margin-bottom:10px;">5. What was one concept you struggled with but eventually understood?</h2>
    <p style="color:#d1d5db; line-height:1.7;">
      I struggled the most with <strong>Segment Trees</strong> initially.  
      The idea of dividing an array into ranges and building a tree on top of it seemed confusing.  
      But after implementing it, I realized how powerful it is for fast range queries.  
      It also made me appreciate how much thought goes into designing efficient data structures.

    <p style="color:#d1d5db; line-height:1.7;">
      The biggest skill I gained is the ability to <strong>break a large real-world problem into smaller algorithmic steps</strong>.  
      Whether it's routing emergency vehicles, predicting hotspots, or building intelligent systems —  
      I now feel confident analyzing the problem, choosing the right algorithm, and validating efficiency.  
      This analytical thinking will help me in development, interviews, and any technical project I take on.
