<p class="subtitle">
  A deeper and more personal reflection on how the concepts of algorithms shaped my understanding 
  of real-world problem solving, structured thinking, and how I now see the world through a 
  computational lens.

      <h2>1. Problems in Nature: Iteration, Recursion & Backtracking</h2>

    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Observing nature made algorithms feel natural. Waves crashing repeatedly looked like 
        <strong>iteration</strong>, the branching of trees resembled <strong>recursion</strong>,
        and the way ants search, fail, and retry reminded me of <strong>backtracking</strong>.
        It changed how I see patterns — algorithms are not just man-made logic; they are reflections 
        of the world around us.

      <h2>2. Space & Time Efficiency – Why They Matter</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">⏳</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        I realised efficiency is not a luxury — it is a necessity.  
        At a city scale, an inefficient algorithm doesn’t just “run slowly,”  
        it becomes impossible to use. Understanding complexities like O(n), 
        O(n log n) or O(n²) made me appreciate how critical optimisation is 
        in real systems.

    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Decomposition, modularity, and abstraction made even complex systems feel manageable.  
        Breaking a large problem into meaningful chunks helped me think clearly and confidently.  
        Now I apply this mindset in coding, academics, and even in daily decision-making.

      <h2>4. How Trees Optimise Data</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">🌲</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Trees taught me elegance in structure. BSTs allow fast searching,  
        AVL/2-3 trees maintain balance, heaps prioritise decisions,  
        and tries make text searching unbelievably fast.  
        In our project, trees ensured that data wasn’t just stored — it was organised intelligently.

      <h2>5. Why Segment Trees / Fenwick Trees?</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">📊</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        High-frequency queries demand smarter data structures.  
        Segment Trees and Fenwick Trees reduced operations from linear to logarithmic time.  
        Seeing them speed up large-scale queries made me understand how large systems maintain performance.

      <div class="icon-badge">🗺️</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Trees helped me organise information, but graphs helped me understand relationships.  
        Viewing the city as a graph — roads as edges, locations as nodes — made BFS, DFS, and 
        Dijkstra feel powerful and real. It changed my perception of movement, travel, and connectivity.

      <div class="icon-badge">🔍</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Sorting and searching silently power almost everything: emergency ranking, database lookups, 
        route ordering, and optimisation. They may feel basic,  
        but they are the backbone of efficient systems.

      <p>
        Graph algorithms felt like magic.  
        MSTs helped design efficient infrastructure,  
        Dijkstra optimized emergency routing,  
        BFS simplified evacuation simulations.  
        They transformed our city model from a sketch into an intelligent, data-driven system.

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Every algorithmic technique taught me a new way of thinking:  
        brute force reminded me to explore everything honestly,  
        greedy taught quick judgment,  
        divide-and-conquer taught discipline,  
        backtracking taught patience,  
        dynamic programming taught learning from the past.  
        Algorithm design became a way of thinking, not just coding.

      <h2>10. How This Project Changed Me</h2>
      <div class="icon-badge">💡</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        This project made algorithms feel human and impactful.  
        For the first time, a shortest path wasn’t just math — it became a life-saving idea.  
        A graph wasn’t just edges and nodes — it became a blueprint for an entire city.  
        I realised that algorithm design is not just logic; it is responsibility, creativity, and empathy.
