        <h2>Section 1: Identified Business Ideas</h2>

        <p>
            Modern cities face a wide range of emergencies—medical crises, road accidents, fires, crimes, and sudden natural disasters. 
            To handle these rapidly and effectively, our project proposes a 
            <b>Smart Emergency Response System (SERS)</b> that integrates routing, resource allocation, disaster management, 
            and predictive analytics. This aligns with the United Nations 
            <b>SDGs 3, 9, 11, 13, and 16</b>, aiming to create safer and more resilient cities.
