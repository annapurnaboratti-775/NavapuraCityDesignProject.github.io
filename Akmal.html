        <h2>Section 1: Identified Business Ideas</h2>

        <p>
            Modern cities face a wide range of emergencies—medical crises, road accidents, fires, crimes, and sudden natural disasters. 
            To handle these rapidly and effectively, our project proposes a 
            <b>Smart Emergency Response System (SERS)</b> that integrates routing, disaster management, 
            fire hazard prediction, and predictive policing. This aligns with the United Nations 
            <b>SDGs 3, 9, 11, 13, and 16</b>, creating safer and more resilient urban environments.

        <h3>🔶 Smart Emergency Response Control Centre (SERCC)</h3>

        <p>
            The <b>Smart Emergency Response Control Centre</b> acts as the central command hub for all emergency services. 
            It provides a unified digital platform for monitoring, dispatching, and coordinating ambulances, 
            fire engines, and police units across the city.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Live tracking of all emergency vehicles.</li>
            <li>Automatic dispatch based on proximity and availability.</li>
            <li>Predicts response time using real-time traffic data.</li>
            <li>Dynamic rerouting during roadblocks or congestion.</li>
            <li>Enhances coordination during peak times and major incidents.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Impact:</b> Faster responses, reduced delays, and improved emergency handling efficiency.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>🔶 Intelligent Ambulance Routing Network</h3>

        <p>
            This subsystem uses weighted graph algorithms to determine the <b>fastest possible path</b> for ambulances. 
            By considering traffic density, road width, signals, and accident-prone spots, it creates a truly smart routing system.
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Feature</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Real-time routing</td>
                <td>Continuously updates the fastest path</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Smart traffic coordination</td>
                <td>Turns signals green on ambulance path</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Congestion prediction</td>
                <td>Uses stored patterns to avoid high-traffic zones</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Fail-safe routing</td>
                <td>Switches routes instantly when the primary path fails</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p><b>Impact:</b> Reduces ambulance delay by up to 60%, saving countless lives.</p>

        <h3>🔶 Disaster Evacuation & Safe Shelter Planning</h3>

        <p>
            Cities face many disaster risks—floods, fires, chemical leaks, and industrial explosions. 
            This subsystem identifies safe evacuation routes, detects vulnerable zones, and guides citizens 
            to shelters through real-time alerts.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Finds reachable shelters using BFS/DFS.</li>
            <li>Detects bottlenecks and narrow routes in the city.</li>
            <li>Predicts disaster spread using historical and pattern-based analysis.</li>
            <li>Provides evacuation maps and warnings during emergencies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Impact:</b> Strengthens disaster preparedness and ensures safer evacuations.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>🔶 Crime Hotspot Detection & Predictive Policing</h3>

        <p>
            By analyzing call logs and emergency data, the system can identify locations with frequent crimes, 
            accidents, or late-night disturbances. The insights help authorities plan effective patrol routes.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Generates visual heatmaps of risky zones.</li>
            <li>Detects time-based crime trends (night thefts, weekend accidents).</li>
            <li>Suggests shortest, most efficient patrol routes.</li>
            <li>Supports city planning for safer public spaces.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h3>🔶 Integrated Fire Hazard Monitoring & Rapid Response</h3>

        <p>
            Fires can escalate rapidly. This subsystem combines sensor networks, weather data, and routing algorithms 
            to ensure the fastest arrival of fire engines and prevent secondary fires.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Automatic alerts from fire sensors installed across the city.</li>
            <li>Maps show nearest fire stations and hydrants.</li>
            <li>Considers road width & slope to choose best truck route.</li>
            <li>Predicts fire spread direction using wind patterns.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Impact:</b> Saves infrastructure, prevents fire spread, and reduces casualties.</p>
